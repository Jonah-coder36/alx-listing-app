# ALX Listing App
## Project Description
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.
## Project Goals
This milestone is designed for professional developers to strengthen their expertise in modern web application development. By completing this milestone, learners will:          - Gain hands-on experience scaffolding a Next.js project tailored for production readiness.
- Implement TypeScript for type safety and reusable interfaces to enhance code maintainability and robustness.
- Configure TailwindCSS for building responsive, accessible, and visually appealing UI components.
- Structure a Next.js project following industry-standard best practices, ensuring scalability and readability.
- Create foundational reusable components and organize assets effectively for real-world applications.
## Project Structure
Next.js is a React-based web framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR) — all in one. Its project structure reflects this hybrid nature and emphasizes modularity, routing, and scalability.
1. Components
- They are houses reusable UI components.
- Examples: buttons, cards, navigation bars, footers.
- Promotes separation of concerns by isolating presentational elements.
- Encourages modularity and reusability. 
2. Interfaces
- Example: interfaces for user objects, API responses, form data
- Defines the application’s routing and UI structure.
3. Constants
- They store fixed values or configurations used across the app.
- Common examples: API endpoints, color codes, roles, messages.
- Keeps hardcoded values organized and easily manageable.
3. Public/Assets
-To store static files, such as:Images (logos, icons, illustrations), Fonts and JSON files or manifest files.
